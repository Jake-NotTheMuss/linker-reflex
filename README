linker-reflex

This is a set of scripts I use to reverse engineer the flex lexers in
linker_modtools. The makefile is used for building a test program from
my own flex input file. The script reflex.sh uses reflex to reverse the
lexer program built from my input file, so it can be compared with the
reversed linker_modtools version.

The 'dumptable' directory contains a script which reverses the linker
flex tables, first by dumping them from linker_modtools, then providing
them to reflex.

Reflex can be found here:
